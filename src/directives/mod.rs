// Placeholder module for advanced directives (Phase 5 feature)
// This would contain conditional directives, templates, and advanced processing
// Currently simplified to avoid dead code warnings

// Future implementation would include:
// - Conditional directives based on environment variables
// - Path-based conditional rules
// - Template system for reusable configurations
// - Advanced directive processing logic

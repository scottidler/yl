I've been configuring yamlfmt to run on files I edit. one really annoying thing about it is that it loves re-combining strings that have been split up for a reason, like this one. I can't find a config setting that would override it, other than just explicitly ignore the whole file. Doesn't have any concept of reading comments to disable rules like yamlint either.

I tried to get cursor to format a sql stanza "in the same style" as a previous chunk I fed it and boy... was that a freakin journey of awfulness

from docs, it looks like I could write my own formatter for yamlfmt...

it would be cool if a linter could interpret comments to "tweak" format style inline

I could maybe write a yaml linter in rust......
